sc_erl_datasets
===============

Various datasets that my other erlang garbage uses, because centralization :rage2:

Currently includes:

* [Fisher's Iris](https://github.com/StoneCypher/sc_erl_datasets/blob/master/src/sc_fisher_iris.erl) dataset
* [Anscombe's Quartet](https://github.com/StoneCypher/sc_erl_datasets/blob/master/src/sc_anscombes_quartet.erl) dataset



Polemic :neckbeard:
